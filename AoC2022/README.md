Second year where I am doing this challenge. I will do it in Python and post my solutions here.

The goal of this calendar is skill-improving, self-teaching and the improvement of one's will to challenge.

Private Leaderboard accessible via request.


Top 976 on day 16 yuhu, first time being in top 1000.


I follow my progress on Mathis Hammel's Leaderboard, as for the general one, I would have needed to wake up at 6am every day.
